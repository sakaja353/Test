Stir in the chicken stock, bring to a boil, cover, then simmer for 10 m. Add the chicken, remove half the mixture, then puree with a stick blender. Tip back into the pan with the rest of the soup, the peas and seasoning, then simmer for 5 m until hot through. Mix the Greek yoghurt, garlic and lemon juice together. Ladle the soup into bowls, swirl in the garlic yoghurt, then serve."

    "instructions": "Lightly whisk eggs, single cream and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency. Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs. Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 s. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan. Let it sit for another 10 s then stir and fold again. Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay."
